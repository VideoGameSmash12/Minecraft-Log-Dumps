[20:54:16] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <ImGannaFindYou> i used the flying machine concept
[20:54:25] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <ImGannaFindYou> but it actually filled in the blocks
[20:54:26] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < RoboEx> but could it close too?
[20:54:32] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <ImGannaFindYou> oh yeah
