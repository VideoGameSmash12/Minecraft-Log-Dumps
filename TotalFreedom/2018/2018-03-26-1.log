[19:12:44] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [BetterChairs] Find new update ! Version: 0.9.5
[19:12:44] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [UPDATE]
[19:12:51] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <FileExtension> Im ready
[19:13:07] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> oh rip
[19:13:11] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> but basically
[19:13:21] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> in programming its technically impossible to hit infinity
[19:13:21] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [SrA] < coolfilez> you have a point i see
[19:13:30] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> 2048 is 2^10
[19:13:36] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> and thats probably the highest value they have set
[19:13:42] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <Dash_The_Dog_YT> infinity is not even a confirmed number
[19:13:42] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] PacMax1121 was killed by magic
[19:13:44] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <FileExtension> doned
[19:13:45] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <GoergeHennon> lol
[19:13:50] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <VideoGameSmash12> well you could hit infinity
[19:13:51] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> because calculatiing infinity is technically impossible
[19:13:55] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [SrA] < coolfilez> technically it's not a real number
[19:13:59] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> ^
[19:14:00] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <GoergeHennon> its the same as being gmc vs gmc player with this lol
[19:14:05] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <FileExtension> yep xd
[19:14:06] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <Dash_The_Dog_YT> its just a concept
[19:14:24] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] [RedstoneMB] < RoboEx> but xfilez thats probably why
[19:14:29] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <VideoGameSmash12> You could hit infinity, but it would cause an error. All you need to do to hit infinity is divide 0 by 0.
[19:14:33] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <GoergeHennon> shoulding this be called gmc pvp xd
[19:14:44] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <GoergeHennon> shoulding
[19:14:45] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <Dash_The_Dog_YT> and it would probably crash
[19:14:46] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < george> give whiskey beer or die

[19:16:16] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <FileExtension> For the custom attributes, you need to make a standard attribute, like attack damage. But change the generic.attackDamage to something else
[19:16:17] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < george> hey buy my books
[19:16:19] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <FileExtension> it can be anything

[19:16:33] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] < South> dUDE
[19:16:42] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] <FileExtension> However, because there's an actual attribute behind it, thats not the name, that "custom attribute" will act the same as a standard attack damage attribute
