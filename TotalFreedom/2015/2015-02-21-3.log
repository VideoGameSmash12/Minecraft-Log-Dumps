[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 1. No threatening to DDoS other players and/or VideoFreedom: This one is pretty self-explanatory, if you threaten to DDoS a player and/or the VideoFreedom server, you will be automatically banned and I will take full action of permanently banning you. Do not try to even joke about it. I take DDoS jokes seriously. By the way, DDoSing is ILLEGAL. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 2. No DoXing admins/players of VideoFreedom: In the case of wanting to get "revenge" on a player/admin when they smite/ban you, your action might be to DoX the player/admin. If you do such a thing, I will take full action of permanently banning you. Don't even think about it. I will not tolerate jokes about DoXing. Period.
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 3. Lying on admin applications is not allowed: This one is also self-explanatory, if you lie on your admin application anywhere and I find out, you will be forum banned for 5 days and you will not get admin! Don't even think about it.
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 
[17:31:28] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] 4. Do not hijack threads, bump old threads, misplace threads, or post spam threads: This one just makes me mad. If you hijack a thread, I will warn you strongly to not do that. If you bump an old thread and it's not important, your post will be deleted and you will be warned.
